## Overview

Exchange Rates API provides Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) exchange rates for Australian business regulatory compliance. This guide covers compliance requirements for different use cases.

<Note>
This guide provides general information only. Consult qualified professionals for specific requirements.
</Note>

## ATO Compliance

### Currency Conversion Requirements

The ATO requires businesses to convert foreign currency amounts to AUD for tax purposes using reasonable exchange rates.

<Card title="ATO Acceptable Methods" icon="check">

The ATO accepts these exchange rate sources:
- Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) - our primary source
- Published rates from major banks
- Recognized financial publications

Our API provides official RBA rates, making it ATO compliant.

</Card>

### Record Keeping Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction Records" icon="file">
    For each foreign currency transaction, maintain:
    - Original foreign currency amount
    - Exchange rate used (rate and source)
    - AUD equivalent amount
    - Date of transaction
    - Date rate was obtained (if different)
    
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "query": {
        "from": "AUD",
        "to": "USD", 
        "amount": 10000
      },
      "info": {
        "timestamp": 1725148800,
        "rate": 0.643512
      },
      "date": "2025-09-01",
      "result": 6435.12
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Exchange Rate Evidence" icon="receipt">
    The ATO requires evidence of exchange rates used:
    - API response logs with timestamps
    - Source attribution (RBA via Exchange Rates API)
    - Rate calculation method (documented process)
    - Consistency in rate selection methodology
    
    Store API responses with X-Request-Id for audit trails.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="GST on Digital Services" icon="calculator">
    For international B2B services:
    - Convert foreign currency invoices at transaction date
    - Use consistent rate source throughout reporting period
    - Document rate selection methodology
    - Maintain 5-year record retention
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Practical Implementation

<CodeGroup>

```javascript ATO-Compliant Conversion
class ATOCompliantConverter {
  constructor(apiKey) {
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
    this.auditLog = [];
  }
  
  async convertForATO(amount, fromCurrency, transactionDate) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/convert?` +
        `from=${fromCurrency}&to=AUD&amount=${amount}&date=${transactionDate}`,
        {
          headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}` }
        }
      );
      
      const data = await response.json();
      
      const auditRecord = {
        transactionDate,
        originalAmount: amount,
        originalCurrency: fromCurrency,
        exchangeRate: data.info.rate,
        audAmount: data.result,
        source: 'Reserve Bank of Australia via Exchange Rates API',
        rateDate: data.date,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        requestId: response.headers.get('X-Request-Id')
      };
      
      this.auditLog.push(auditRecord);
      
      return {
        audAmount: data.result,
        exchangeRate: data.info.rate,
        auditRecord
      };
      
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('ATO conversion failed:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  
  getAuditTrail(startDate, endDate) {
    return this.auditLog.filter(record => 
      record.transactionDate >= startDate && 
      record.transactionDate <= endDate
    );
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Financial Reporting Standards

### AASB Compliance

For businesses following Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) requirements:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AASB 121 - Foreign Currency" icon="book">
    Exchange Rate Selection:
    - Use spot rate at transaction date
    - For practical reasons, use average rate for period if appropriate
    - Ensure consistent application across reporting periods
    
    Our API provides both historical spot rates and period averages via `/timeseries`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Fair Value Measurements" icon="balance-scale">
    When using exchange rates for fair value:
    - Rates must be from principal (or most advantageous) market
    - RBA rates represent the principal Australian market
    - Document rate source and methodology
    - Maintain consistency across reporting periods
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Disclosure Requirements" icon="eye">
    Financial statements must disclose:
    - Exchange rate policy (source and timing)
    - Significant rate changes during period
    - Methods used for translation
    - Functional vs presentation currency considerations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Monthly/Quarterly Reporting

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Period Average Rates
async function getPeriodAverageRate(fromCurrency, startDate, endDate) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/timeseries?` +
    `start_date=${startDate}&end_date=${endDate}&symbols=${fromCurrency}`,
    {
      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key' }
    }
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  const rates = Object.values(data.rates).map(day => day[fromCurrency]);
  const averageRate = rates.reduce((sum, rate) => sum + rate, 0) / rates.length;
  
  return {
    averageRate: parseFloat(averageRate.toFixed(6)),
    periodStart: startDate,
    periodEnd: endDate,
    dataPoints: rates.length,
    source: 'Reserve Bank of Australia'
  };
}
```

```python Period-End Rates  
def get_period_end_rate(currency: str, period_end_date: str) -> Dict:
    
    url = f"https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/{period_end_date}/{currency}"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    data = response.json()
    
    if not data["success"]:
        return get_last_available_rate(currency, period_end_date)
    
    return {
        "rate": data["rates"][currency],
        "date": data["date"],
        "period_end": period_end_date,
        "source": "Reserve Bank of Australia"
    }
```

</CodeGroup>

## Privacy & Data Protection

### GDPR Compliance

Although this API serves financial data (not personal data), some considerations apply:

<Card title="Data Processing" icon="shield">

What We Process:
- API usage patterns (for rate limiting)
- Request metadata (for debugging)
- Account information (for authentication)

What We Don't Process:
- End-user personal data
- Transaction details beyond API parameters
- Customer business data

</Card>

### Data Retention

| Data Type | Retention Period | Purpose |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| API Requests | 90 days | Debugging and support |
| Usage Analytics | 24 months | Service improvement |
| Account Data | Active + 7 years | Legal/regulatory requirements |
| Error Logs | 30 days | System monitoring |

### Cross-Border Data

- API servers: Located in Australia (Cloudflare edge network)
- Data sovereignty: Complies with Australian data residency
- International access: Available globally via CDN
- No data export: Exchange rates are public information
