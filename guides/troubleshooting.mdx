## Authentication Errors

### Invalid API Key (401)

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": 401,
    "type": "invalid_api_key",
    "info": "Invalid or missing API key."
  }
}
```

**Fix:**
1. Check API key format: `buderim_abc123...`
2. Use correct header: `Authorization: Bearer your_api_key`
3. Verify key is active in dashboard

### Account Suspended (401)

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": 401,
    "type": "account_suspended", 
    "info": "Account is suspended. Please contact support."
  }
}
```

**Causes:**
- Overdue payment
- Terms violation
- Billing issues

**Fix:** Check dashboard and contact support if needed.

## Rate Limits

### Daily Quota Exceeded (429)

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": 429,
    "type": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "info": "Daily quota of 1000 requests exceeded. Quota resets at midnight AEST."
  }
}
```

**Fix:**
- Wait until midnight AEST for reset
- Cache responses (rates update once daily at 4 PM AEST)
- Upgrade plan for higher quota

### Free Tier Limit (429)

Free `/convert` endpoint: 3 requests/hour per IP.

**Fix:**
- Wait 1 hour
- Sign up for 50 requests/day
- Upgrade for unlimited

## Data Issues

### Stale Data

**Indicators:**
- `X-Data-Stale: true` header
- `"stale": true` in response

**Cause:** RBA hasn't updated (weekends, holidays, technical issues)

**Action:** No action needed - system recovers when RBA updates.

### Historical Data Not Found (404)

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": 404,
    "type": "not_found",
    "info": "No data available for date 2017-12-31"
  }
}
```

**Causes:**
- Date before 2018-01-01
- Weekend (RBA publishes Monday-Friday only)
- Australian public holiday
- Future date

## Technical Issues

### Network Timeouts

**Fix:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Test: `curl -I https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/status`
3. Check firewall allows HTTPS (port 443)
4. Implement retry with exponential backoff

### CORS Errors

**Cause:** Browser security blocks direct API calls with authentication.

**Fix:**
- Use backend proxy for API calls
- Never put API keys in frontend code
- For testing only: Use free `/convert` endpoint

## Quick Diagnostics

### 1. Test Status
```bash
curl https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/status
```
Should return `"status": "operational"`

### 2. Test Authentication
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
     https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/latest
```
Should return rate data

### 3. Check Rate Limits
Look for headers:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit-Daily: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Daily: 847
```
