## Authentication Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid API Key Error (401)" icon="key">
    **Symptoms:**
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "code": 401,
        "type": "invalid_api_key",
        "info": "Invalid or missing API key."
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Check API key format: Should be `buderim_abc123...` (suburb prefix + identifier)
    2. Verify Authorization header: Use `Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here`
    3. Check for typos: API keys are case-sensitive
    4. Confirm key is active: Check dashboard for revoked keys
    5. Test with cURL:
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer buderim_your_api_key" \
         https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/status
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Account Suspended (401)" icon="ban">
    **Symptoms:**
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "code": 401,
        "type": "account_suspended",
        "info": "Account is suspended. Please contact support."
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Common Causes:**
    - Overdue payment on paid plans
    - Terms of service violations
    - Suspicious activity detection
    - Billing card issues
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Check dashboard for account status
    2. Update payment method if billing-related
    3. Contact support at [support@exchangeratesapi.com.au](mailto:support@exchangeratesapi.com.au)

## Rate Limiting Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Quota Exceeded (429)" icon="gauge">
    **Symptoms:**
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "code": 429,
        "type": "rate_limit_exceeded",
        "info": "Daily quota of 1000 requests exceeded. Quota resets at midnight AEST."
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Immediate Solutions:**
    1. Wait for reset: Quotas reset at midnight AEST
    2. Check usage: Monitor quota in dashboard
    3. Implement caching: Reduce API calls by caching responses
    4. Upgrade plan: Increase daily quota
    
    **Prevention:**
    - Cache exchange rates (they update once daily at 4 PM AEST)
    - Batch multiple currency needs into single `/latest` calls
    - Monitor quota usage proactively
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Free Tier Limit Exceeded (429)" icon="clock">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Free `/convert` endpoint returns 429 error
    - Header: `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0`
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Wait 1 hour: Free tier allows 3 requests per hour per IP
    2. Sign up: Get 50 requests/day with free account
    3. Use different endpoint: Try `/latest` with conversion math
    4. Upgrade plan: Get unlimited conversion requests
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data Quality Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Stale Data Warning" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Response headers: `X-Data-Stale: true`
    - Response field: `"stale": true`
    - Data older than expected
    
    **Explanation:**
    - RBA typically updates at 4:00 PM AEST Monday-Friday
    - If RBA doesn't update (holidays, technical issues), we serve previous day's rates
    - This ensures API availability even when source data is delayed
    
    **Actions:**
    1. No action needed: System automatically recovers when RBA updates
    2. Check RBA directly: [rba.gov.au](https://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/frequency/exchange-rates.html)
    3. Monitor status: Check status page
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Historical Data Not Available (404)" icon="calendar-times">
    **Symptoms:**
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "code": 404,
        "type": "not_found",
        "info": "No data available for date 2017-12-31"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Causes:**
    - Date before January 1, 2018 (our historical data start date)
    - Weekend or Australian public holiday (RBA doesn't publish rates)
    - Date in the future
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Use valid date range: 2018-01-01 to yesterday
    2. Skip weekends: RBA only publishes Monday-Friday
    3. Check Australian holidays

## Technical Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Network Timeouts" icon="wifi">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Connection timeouts
    - DNS resolution failures
    - Intermittent connectivity issues
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Check internet connection: Verify basic connectivity
    2. Test with cURL: `curl -I https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/status`
    3. Check corporate firewall: Ensure HTTPS (port 443) is allowed
    4. Implement retries: Use exponential backoff for transient failures
    5. Monitor status page: Check for known issues
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="CORS Errors in Browser" icon="globe">
    **Symptoms:**
    - CORS policy blocks in browser console
    - Preflight OPTIONS requests failing
    
    **Explanation:**
    - API keys should not be used in frontend JavaScript
    - Browser security prevents direct API calls from websites
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Use backend proxy: Make API calls from your server
    2. For testing only: Use free `/convert` endpoint (no auth required)
    3. Example backend endpoint:
    ```javascript
    app.get('/api/rates', async (req, res) => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/latest', {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}` }
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      res.json(data);
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### Quick Diagnostic Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test API Status">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/status
    ```
    Should return `"status": "operational"`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Authentication">
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" \
         https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/latest
    ```
    Should return exchange rate data
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Quota Usage">
    Look for rate limit headers in response:
    ```
    X-RateLimit-Limit-Daily: 1000
    X-RateLimit-Remaining-Daily: 847
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Error Response">
    All errors include structured information:
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "code": 400,
        "type": "bad_request",
        "info": "Detailed error message"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
