## Common Issues & Solutions

### Authentication Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid API Key Error (401)" icon="key">
    **Symptoms:**
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "code": 401,
        "type": "invalid_api_key",
        "info": "Invalid or missing API key."
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check API key format**: Should be `buderim_abc123...` (suburb prefix + identifier)
    2. **Verify Authorization header**: Use `Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here`
    3. **Check for typos**: API keys are case-sensitive
    4. **Confirm key is active**: Check dashboard for revoked keys
    5. **Test with cURL**:
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer buderim_your_api_key" \
         https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/status
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Account Suspended (401)" icon="ban">
    **Symptoms:**
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "code": 401,
        "type": "account_suspended",
        "info": "Account is suspended. Please contact support."
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Common Causes:**
    - Overdue payment on paid plans
    - Terms of service violations
    - Suspicious activity detection
    - Billing card issues
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Check [dashboard](https://app.exchangeratesapi.com.au) for account status
    2. Update payment method if billing-related
    3. Contact support at [support@exchangeratesapi.com.au](mailto:support@exchangeratesapi.com.au)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Rate Limiting Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Quota Exceeded (429)" icon="gauge">
    **Symptoms:**
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "code": 429,
        "type": "rate_limit_exceeded",
        "info": "Daily quota of 1000 requests exceeded. Quota resets at midnight AEST."
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Immediate Solutions:**
    1. **Wait for reset**: Quotas reset at midnight AEST
    2. **Check usage**: Monitor quota in [dashboard](https://app.exchangeratesapi.com.au)
    3. **Implement caching**: Reduce API calls by caching responses
    4. **Upgrade plan**: Increase daily quota
    
    **Prevention:**
    - Cache exchange rates (they update once daily at 4 PM AEST)
    - Batch multiple currency needs into single `/latest` calls
    - Monitor quota usage proactively
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Free Tier Limit Exceeded (429)" icon="clock">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Free `/convert` endpoint returns 429 error
    - Header: `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0`
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Wait 1 hour**: Free tier allows 3 requests per hour per IP
    2. **Sign up**: Get 50 requests/day with [free account](/quickstart)
    3. **Use different endpoint**: Try `/latest` with conversion math
    4. **Upgrade plan**: Get unlimited conversion requests
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Data Quality Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Stale Data Warning" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Response headers: `X-Data-Stale: true`
    - Response field: `"stale": true`
    - Data older than expected
    
    **Explanation:**
    - RBA typically updates at 4:00 PM AEST Monday-Friday
    - If RBA doesn't update (holidays, technical issues), we serve previous day's rates
    - This ensures API availability even when source data is delayed
    
    **Actions:**
    1. **No action needed**: System automatically recovers when RBA updates
    2. **Check RBA directly**: [rba.gov.au](https://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/frequency/exchange-rates.html)
    3. **Monitor status**: Check [status page](https://status.exchangeratesapi.com.au)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Historical Data Not Available (404)" icon="calendar-xmark">
    **Symptoms:**
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "code": 404,
        "type": "not_found",
        "info": "No data available for date 2017-12-31"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Causes:**
    - Date before January 1, 2018 (our historical data start date)
    - Weekend or Australian public holiday (RBA doesn't publish rates)
    - Date in the future
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Use valid date range**: 2018-01-01 to yesterday
    2. **Skip weekends**: RBA only publishes Monday-Friday
    3. **Check [Australian holidays](https://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/special-dates-and-events/public-holidays)**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Technical Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Network Timeouts" icon="wifi">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Connection timeouts
    - DNS resolution failures
    - Intermittent connectivity issues
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check internet connection**: Verify basic connectivity
    2. **Test with cURL**: `curl -I https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/status`
    3. **Check corporate firewall**: Ensure HTTPS (port 443) is allowed
    4. **Implement retries**: Use exponential backoff for transient failures
    5. **Monitor [status page](https://status.exchangeratesapi.com.au)**: Check for known issues
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="CORS Errors in Browser" icon="globe">
    **Symptoms:**
    - CORS policy blocks in browser console
    - Preflight OPTIONS requests failing
    
    **Explanation:**
    - API keys should not be used in frontend JavaScript
    - Browser security prevents direct API calls from websites
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Use backend proxy**: Make API calls from your server
    2. **For testing only**: Use free `/convert` endpoint (no auth required)
    3. **Example backend endpoint**:
    ```javascript
    // Your backend API
    app.get('/api/rates', async (req, res) => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/latest', {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}` }
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      res.json(data);
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### Quick Diagnostic Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test API Status">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/status
    ```
    Should return `"status": "operational"`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Authentication">
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" \
         https://api.exchangeratesapi.com.au/latest
    ```
    Should return exchange rate data
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Quota Usage">
    Look for rate limit headers in response:
    ```
    X-RateLimit-Limit-Daily: 1000
    X-RateLimit-Remaining-Daily: 847
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Error Response">
    All errors include structured information:
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "code": 400,
        "type": "bad_request",
        "info": "Detailed error message"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
