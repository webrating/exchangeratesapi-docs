## Overview

The root endpoint provides basic information about the Exchange Rates API, including the current version and links to documentation. This endpoint is **public** and doesn't require authentication.

This is the entry point for the API and can be used to verify that the service is accessible and to get basic metadata about the API version and capabilities.
